# Marketing Campaign Strategy

## Platform Priority

**Primary: Twitter/X** - Type design community is very active here

- Daily tips, progress updates, comparison shots
- Easy to engage with other designers, quote-tweet their work

**Secondary: YouTube Shorts / TikTok**

- Repurpose same content across both
- "Font editing tricks" format performs well

**Tertiary: TypeDrawers forum**

- Weekly thoughtful posts, not promotional
- Answer questions, establish expertise

## Content Strategy (30min/day)

**3 shorts per week** (record batch on weekends):

1. **Before/After transformations** - "Fixed this spacing issue in 10 seconds"
2. **AI Assistant demos** - "Watch the AI explain this anchor point problem"
3. **Feature highlights** - "Here's how live interpolation preview works"

**Daily Twitter** (5-10min):

- Screenshot + insight about font editing
- Comment on other designers' work
- Polls about pain points in current tools

**Pre-launch (8-12 weeks out):**

- Weeks 1-4: Problem-focused content ("Ever struggled with...")
- Weeks 5-8: Solution teasers ("Working on something to fix...")
- Weeks 9-12: Feature reveals, beta signups
- Launch week: Case studies, testimonials from early testers

## High-Converting Content Types

1. **Speed comparisons** - "This took 2 hours in Glyphs, 15min here"
2. **AI assistant interactions** - Show it catching errors, suggesting fixes
3. **Browser-based wins** - "Editing on iPad, no install needed"
4. **Pain point solutions** - Address specific Glyphs/FontLab frustrations

## Conversion Funnel

- Free tier with limitations → Captures emails
- Weekly email: 1 advanced tip + product update
- Highlight AI features that require subscription
- Offer annual discount for early adopters

**Key metric:** Get designers to open a font in the editor (activation moment). Once they experience the speed/browser advantage, conversion improves.

## Focus

Focus on **demonstrating value** over features. Type designers care about workflow efficiency and output quality, not tech stack.

## Pricing

- $10/month or $100/year for AI assistant and project support
